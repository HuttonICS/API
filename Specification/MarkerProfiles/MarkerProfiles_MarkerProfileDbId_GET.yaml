      summary: Alleles By Markerprofile Id
      description: |-
        **Scope**:GENOTYPING.
        **Status**: ACCEPTED.
        **Implemented by**: Germinate, Cassavabase
        </br>
        For the requested markerprofile ID, returns the allele call for each marker. 
        [Example](http://malt.pw.usda.gov/t3/wheatplus/markerprofiles/1784_99/count?analysisMethod=GoldenGate)
        </br>
        **Allele encodings**
        
        - Unknown data will by default be encoded by "N"
        - Homozygotes are returned as a single occurance, e.g. AA -> A, GG -> G
        - Phased heterozygotes are by default separated by a pipe ("|") and unphased heterozygotes are by default separated by a forward slash ("/")
        - Dominant markers such as DArTs: 1 for present, 0 for absent
        
        **Parameters**
        - If the user would like to use an empty string ("") for any of the parameters, the value should be set to the reserved word "empty_string", e.g. sepUnphased=empty_string.
        
        **Open issue:**
        The pages of data will need to be sorted sensibly in order for the
        requested page to be delivered consistently.  By map or genome position?
        Alphabetically?'
