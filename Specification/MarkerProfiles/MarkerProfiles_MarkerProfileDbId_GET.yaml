        Allele encodings
        
        - Unknown data will by default be encoded by \"N\"
        
        - Homozygotes are returned as a single occurance, e.g. AA -> A, GG -> G
        
        - Phased heterozygotes are by default separated by a pipe (\"|\") and unphased heterozygotes are by default separated by a forward slash (\"/\")
        
        - Dominant markers such as DArTs: 1 for present, 0 for absent
                
        - If the user would like to use an empty string (\"\") for any of the parameters, the value should be set to the reserved word \"empty_string\", e.g. sepUnphased=empty_string.
