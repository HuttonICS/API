      description: "Class of the scale, entries can be \n\n  \"Code\" -  This scale class is exceptionally used to express complex traits. Code is a nominal\n            scale that combines the expressions of the different traits composing the complex\n            trait. For exemple a severity trait might be expressed by a 2 digit and 2 character\n            code. The first 2 digits are the percentage of the plant covered by a fungus and the 2\n            characters refer to the delay in development, e.g. \"75VD\" means \"75%\" of the plant is \n            Crop Ontology & Integrated Breeding Platform | Curation Guidelines | 5/6/2016 9\n            infected and the plant is very delayed.\n  \n  \"Date\" - The date class is for events expressed in a time format, e.g. yyyymmddThh:mm:ssZ or dd/mm/yy\n  \n  \"Duration\" - The Duration class is for time elapsed between two events expressed in a time format, e.g. days, hours, months\n  \n  \"Nominal\" - Categorical scale that can take one of a limited and fixed number of categories. There is no intrinsic ordering to the categories\n  \n  \"Numerical\" - Numerical scales express the trait with real numbers. The numerical scale defines the unit e.g. centimeter, ton per hectar, branches\n  \n  \"Ordinal\" - Ordinal scales are scales composed of ordered categories\n  \n  \"Text\" - A free text is used to express the trait.\n  "
