        Class of the scale, entries can be 
        
          "Code" -  This scale class is exceptionally used to express complex traits. Code is a nominal
                    scale that combines the expressions of the different traits composing the complex
                    trait. For exemple a severity trait might be expressed by a 2 digit and 2 character
                    code. The first 2 digits are the percentage of the plant covered by a fungus and the 2
                    characters refer to the delay in development, e.g. “75VD” means “75% of the plant is

                    infected and the plant is very delayed”.
          
          "Date" - The date class is for events expressed in a time format, e.g. “yyyymmddThh:mm:ssZ” or “dd/mm/yy”
          
          "Duration" - The Duration class is for time elapsed between two events expressed in a time format, e.g. “days”, “hours”, “months”
          
          "Nominal" - Categorical scale that can take one of a limited and fixed number of categories. There is no intrinsic ordering to the categories
          
          "Numerical" - Numerical scales express the trait with real numbers. The numerical scale defines the unit e.g. centimeter, ton per hectar, branches
          
          "Ordinal" - Ordinal scales are scales composed of ordered categories
          
          "Text" - A free text is used to express the trait.
