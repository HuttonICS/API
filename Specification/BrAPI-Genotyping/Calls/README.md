### Get Search Calls by searchResultsDbId  [GET /brapi/v1/search/calls/{searchResultsDbId}{?page}{?pageSize}]

Returns a filtered list of `Call` JSON objects.
See Search Services for additional implementation details.



**Response Fields** 

|Field|Type|Description|
|---|---|---| 
|data|array[object]||
|variantName|string|The name of the variant this call belongs to.|
|phaseset|string|If this field is populated, this variant call's genotype ordering implies the phase of the bases and is consistent with any other variant calls on the same contig which have the same phaseset string.|
|genotype|object|`ListValue` is a wrapper around a repeated field of values.  The JSON representation for `ListValue` is JSON array.|
|values|array|Repeated field of dynamically typed values.|
|callSetName|string|The name of the call set this variant call belongs to. If this field is not present, the ordering of the call sets from a `SearchCallSetsRequest` over this `VariantSet` is guaranteed to match the ordering of the calls on this `Variant`. The number of results will also be the same.|
|genotype_likelihood|array[number]|The genotype likelihoods for this variant call. Each array entry represents how likely a specific genotype is for this call as log10(P(data  genotype)), analogous to the GL tag in the VCF spec. The value ordering is defined by the GL tag in the VCF spec.|
|variantDbId|string|The ID of the variant this call belongs to.|
|callSetDbId|string|The ID of the call set this variant call belongs to.  If this field is not present, the ordering of the call sets from a `SearchCallSetsRequest` over this `VariantSet` is guaranteed to match the ordering of the calls on this `Variant`. The number of results will also be the same.|
|additionalInfo|object|Additional arbitrary info|
|unknownString|string|The string used as a representation for missing data.|
|sepPhased|string|The string used as a separator for phased allele calls.|
|expandHomozygotes|boolean|Should homozygotes be expanded (true) or collapsed into a single occurence (false)|
|sepUnphased|string|The string used as a separator for unphased allele calls.|


 

+ Parameters
    + searchResultsDbId (Required, ) ... Permanent unique identifier which references the search results
    + page (Optional, ) ... Which result page is requested. The page indexing starts at 0 (the first page is 'page'= 0). Default is `0`.
    + pageSize (Optional, ) ... The size of the pages to be returned. Default is `1000`.
    + Authorization (Optional, ) ... HTTP HEADER - Token used for Authorization <strong> Bearer {token_string} </strong>
