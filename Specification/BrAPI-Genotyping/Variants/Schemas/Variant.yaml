    Variant:
      type: object
      description: |-
        A `Variant` represents a change in DNA sequence relative to some reference.
        For example, a variant could represent a SNP or an insertion.
        Variants belong to a `VariantSet`.
        This is equivalent to a row in VCF.

        alternate_bases:
          description: The bases that appear instead of the reference bases. Multiple alternate alleles are possible.

          items:
            format: int32
            type: integer
          description: Similar to "cipos", but for the variant's end position (which is derived from start + svlen).
          example: [ -1000, 0 ]
          type: array
        cipos:

            format: int32
            type: integer
          description: |-
            In the case of structural variants, start and end of the variant may not
            be known with an exact base position. "cipos" provides an interval with
            high confidence for the start position. The interval is provided by 0 or
            2 signed integers which are added to the start position.
            Based on the use in VCFv4.2
          example: [ -12000, 1000 ]
          type: array

          format: int64
          type: string
        end:
          description: The end position (exclusive), resulting in [start, end) closed-open interval. This is typically calculated by `start + referenceBases.length`.

        filtersApplied:
          description: True if filters were applied for this variant. VCF column 7 "FILTER" any value other than the missing value.
          format: boolean
          type: boolean
        filtersFailed:
          description: Zero or more filters that failed for this variant. VCF column 7 "FILTER" shared across all alleles in the same VCF record.
          items:
            type: string
          type: array
        filtersPassed:
          description: True if all filters for this variant passed. VCF column 7 "FILTER" value PASS.

          type: array
        referenceBases:
          description: The reference bases for this variant. They start at the given start position.
          type: string
        referenceName:
          description: The reference on which this variant occurs. (e.g. `chr20` or `X`)
          type: string
          example: chr20
        start:
          description: |-
            The start position at which this variant occurs (0-based).
            This corresponds to the first base of the string of reference bases.
            Genomic positions are non-negative integers less than reference length.
            Variants spanning the join of circular genomes are represented as
            two variants one on each side of the join (position 0).

        svlen:

        variantSetDbId:
          description: An array of `VariantSet` IDs this variant belongs to. This transitively defines the `ReferenceSet` against which the `Variant` is to be interpreted.

            type: string
        variantType:
          description: |-
            The "variant_type" is used to denote e.g. structural variants.
            Examples:
              DUP  : duplication of sequence following "start"; not necessarily in situ
              DEL  : deletion of sequence following "start"
          type: string
          example: DUP
