          The pagination object is applicable only when the payload contains a "data" key. It describes the pagination of the data contained in the "data" array, as a way to identify which subset of data is being returned. Pages are zero indexed, so the first page will be page 0 (zero).

          The status object contains a list of objects with the keys "code" and "message". If no status is reported, an empty list should be returned. The following are officially accepted status codes: 
          Code|Message|Description
          --|--|--
          asynchid|<arbitrary ID String>|Used for the first part of an asynchornous call, returns an ID string which can be used in a subsequent call to retrieve data or status information.
          asynchstatus|"PENDING"|Indicates an asynchornous call is still working and will not return data yet.
          asynchstatus|"FINISHED"|Indicates an asynchornous call is finished and this response object contains the requested data.
          200|"Success"|Optional status for representing explicitly that the request was accepted and returned without any issue
          40|"No objects found for given parameters"| Error to be returned when there are no objects in the database which match the requested search parameters
          41|"Missing required parameter <parameter name>"| Error to be returned when a required parameter is missing from request
          42|"Could not update values for <object type>"| Error to be returned when the server is unable to store some data submitted

      datafiles:
        description: |-
          The datafiles key contains a list of file paths, which can be relative or complete URLs. These files contain additional information related to the returned object and can be retrieved by a subsequent call. The empty list should be returned if no additional data files are present.
