  description: >-
    Use this call for uploading new Observations as a Batched Zip File to a
    system.


    Note: If 'observationUnitDbId' or 'observationDbId' is populated, they
    should be considered updates to existing records. If an existing record of
    that DbId is not found, the document should be treated as new records and
    assigned new DbIds. If 'observationUnitDbId' or 'observationDbId' is
    un-populated (empty string or null) the document should be treated as new
    records and assigned new DbIds.
