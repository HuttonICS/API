        - A term which defines a segment of the year. 
        This could be a traditional season, like "Spring" or "Summer"; 
        this could be a month, like "May" or "June"; 
        or this could be an arbitrary season name which is meaningful to the breeding program like "PlantingTime_3" or "Season E"
