        Note: If 'observationUnitDbId' or 'observationDbId' is populated, they
        should be considered updates to existing records. If an existing record of
        that DbId is not found, the document should be treated as new records and
        assigned new DbIds. If 'observationUnitDbId' or 'observationDbId' is
        un-populated (empty string or null) the document should be treated as new
        records and assigned new DbIds.
