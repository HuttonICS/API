        Returns a list of observationUnit with the observed Phenotypes.
        See Search Services for additional implementation details.
        Use case - this section allows to get a dataset from multiple studies. It allows to integrate data from several databases.
        Refactor note - This call allows to get and integrate portions of multiple phenotyping data matrixes. A proposed evolution allowed to get a list of single observations, this functionality is still possible with this call by specifybing the observation variable, see below.
        Example Use cases 
        - Study a panel of germplasm accross multiple studies
            '{"germplasmDbIds": ["Syrah", "34Mtp362"]}'
        - Get all data for a specific study (same as "/studies/{studyDbId}/observationunits")
            '{"studyDbIds" : ["383"]}'
        - Get simple atomic phenotyping values 
            '{
               "germplasmDbIds" : [ "Syrah", "34Mtp362" ], 
               "observationVariableDbIds" : [ "CO_345:0000043"]
             }'
        - Study Locations for adaptation to climate change
            '{
               "locationDbIds" : ["383838", "MONTPELLIER"], 
               "germplasmDbIds" : [ "14Mtp361", "24Mtp362", "34Mtp363", "44Mtp364"]
             }'
        - Find phenotypes that are from after a certain timestamp
            '{
               "observationTimeStampRangeStart" : "2013-06-14T23:59:59-04:00", 
               "observationTimeStampRangeEnd" : "2013-06-15T23:59:59-04:00"
             }'
             
        observationTimeStampRangeStart and observationTimeStampRangeEnd use Iso Standard 8601.
