        Observation timestamp should be ISO 8601 https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime


        In case where JSON data is zipped for faster transfer speed (as in the case
        of the IRRI handheld implementation), the zipped JSON file will be listed
        in datafiles. The zipped file contains a JSON file with the same structure
        as the BrAPI call. In this case a format parameter should be passed as well.


        Images can be optionally be uploaded using this call by providing a zipfile
        of all images in the datafiles, along with the actual zipfile in multi-part
        form data.
