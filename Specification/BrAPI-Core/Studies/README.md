# Group Study

Study is defined as a phenotyping experiment conducted at a single geographic location. One Trial can have multiple studies conducted (e.g. multi location international trials).

Note that dates should be provided in extended ISO 8601 format (for example, "YYYY-MM-DD").

A "study" in BrAPI represents an "study" in MIAPPE (Minimal Information about a Plant Phenotyping Experiment).

### Get - /seasons [GET /brapi/v2/seasons{?seasonDbId}{?season}{?year}{?page}{?pageSize}]

Call to retrieve all seasons in the database.

A season is made of 2 parts; the primary year and a term which defines a segment of the year. 
This could be a traditional season, like "Spring" or "Summer" or this could be a month, like 
"May" or "June" or this could be an arbitrary season name which is meaningful to the breeding 
program like "PlantingTime_3" or "Season E"



**Response Fields**

|---|---|---| 
|data|array[object]||
|season|string|Name of the season. ex. 'Spring', 'Q2', 'Season A', etc.|
|seasonDbId|string|The ID which uniquely identifies a season. For backward compatibility it can be a string like '2012', '1957-2004'|
|year|integer|The 4 digit year of the season.|
