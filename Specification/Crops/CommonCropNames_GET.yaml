      description: "List the common crop names for the crops available in a database server. \n\nThis call is **required** for multi-crop systems where data from multiple crops may be stored in the same database server. A distinct database server is defined by everything in the URL before \"/brapi/v1\", including host name and base path.  \n\nThis call is recommended for single crop systems to be compatible with multi-crop clients. For a single crop system the response should contain an array with exactly 1 element. \n\nThe common crop name can be used as a search parameter for Programs, Studies, and Germplasm.\n\n\ntest-server.brapi.org/brapi/v1/commonCropNames"
