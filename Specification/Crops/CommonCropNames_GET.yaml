        List the common crop names for the crops available in a database server. 

        This call is **required** for multi-crop systems where data from multiple crops may be stored in the same database server. A distinct database server is defined by everything in the URL before "/brapi/v1", including host name and base path.  
        
        This call is recommended for single crop systems to be compatible with multi-crop clients. For a single crop system the response should contain an array with exactly 1 element. 
        
        The common crop name can be used as a search parameter for Programs, Studies, and Germplasm.
