        Implementation Notes
        
        - 'imageURL' should be a complete URL decribing the location of the image. There is no BrAPI call for retireiving the image content, so it could be on a different path, or a different host.
        
        - 'descriptiveOntologyTerm' can be thought of as Tags for the image. These could be simple descriptive words, or ontology references, or full ontology URI's.

        Update an image meta data object
        
        Implementation Notes
        
        - This call should be paired with 'PUT /images/{imageDbId}/imagecontent' for full capability
        
        - A server may choose to modify the image meta data object based on the actually image which has been uploaded. 
        
        - Image data may be stored in a database or file system. Servers should generate and provide the "imageURL" as an absolute path for retrieving the image, wherever it happens to live. 
        
        - 'descriptiveOntologyTerm' can be thought of as Tags for the image. These could be simple descriptive words, or ontology references, or full ontology URI's.
