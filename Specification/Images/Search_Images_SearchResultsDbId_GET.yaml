        Implementation Notes


        - ''imageURL'' should be a complete URL decribing the location of the image. There is no BrAPI call for retireiving the image content, so it could be on a different path, or a different host.


        - ''descriptiveOntologyTerm'' can be thought of as Tags for the image. These could be simple descriptive words, or ontology references, or full ontology URI''s.  '
