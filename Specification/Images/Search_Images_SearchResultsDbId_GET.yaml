        Implementation Notes
        
        - 'imageURL' should be a complete URL decribing the location of the image. There is no BrAPI call for retireiving the image content, so it could be on a different path, or a different host.
        
        - 'descriptiveOntologyTerm' can be thought of as Tags for the image. These could be simple descriptive words, or ontology references, or full ontology URI's.
