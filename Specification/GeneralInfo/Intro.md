# BrAPI V1.2

The Breeding API specifies a standard interface for plant phenotype/genotype databases to serve their data to crop breeding applications. It is a <i>shared</i>, <i>open</i> API, to be used by all data providers and data consumers who wish to participate. Initiated in May 2014, it is currently in an actively developing state, so now is the time for potential participants to help shape the specifications to ensure their needs are addressed.
