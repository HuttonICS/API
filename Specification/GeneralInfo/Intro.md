# BrAPI V1.3

The Breeding API (BrAPI) is an interface for exchanging plant phenotype and genotype data between crop breeding applications. BrAPI is a standardized specification, meaning that any application may create their own implementation and that all of those implementations should be compatible. It is a <i>shared</i>, <i>open</i> API, to be used by all data providers and data consumers who wish to participate. Initiated in May 2014, it is currently in an actively developing state, so now is the time for potential participants to help shape the specifications to ensure their needs are addressed.
