### Location coordinate encoding

To encode locations as coordinates, the ISO 6709 standard is used. Importantly, the decimal notation is used. Example
latitude: +40.20361, longitude: -075.00417. Note that plus and minus signs are always required, and latitude has two digits before the decimal separator (with leading zeroes when necessary), and longitude has three digits.
