# Group Germplasm Attribute Values
Germplasm "attributes" are simply-inherited characteristics (characterization descriptors) that are not environment-dependent but 
inherent in the germplasm line.  They include genes, QTLs, and genetic "traits" like wheat grain 
hardness.  They are often evaluated by genotyping for diagnostic markers.
