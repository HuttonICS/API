# Group Traits

API to manage the details of observation variable Traits. An observation variable is composed by the unique combination of one Trait, one Method and one Scale. A Trait describes what property is being observed. For example, an Observation Variable might be defined with a Trait of "plant height", a Scale of "meters", and a Method of "tape measure". This Variable would be distinct from a Variable with the Trait "Leaf length" or "Flower height".
