# Group Scales

API to manage the details of observation variable Scales. An observation variable is composed by the unique combination of one Trait, one Method and one Scale. A Scale describes the units and acceptable values for a Variable. For example, an Observation Variable might be defined with a Trait of "plant height", a Scale of "meters", and a Method of "tape measure". This Variable would be distinct from a Variable with the Scale "inches" or "pixels".
