        Implementation Notes

        - ''imageURL'' should be a complete URL describing the location of the image. There is no BrAPI call for retrieving the image content, so it could be on a different path, or a different host.

        - ''descriptiveOntologyTerm'' can be thought of as Tags for the image. These could be simple descriptive words, or ontology references, or full ontology URI''s.
