        Implementation Notes
        
        - ''imageURL'' should be a complete URL describing the location of the image. There is no BrAPI call for retrieving the image content, so it could be on a different path, or a different host.
        
        - 'descriptiveOntologyTerm' can be thought of as Tags for the image. These could be simple descriptive words, or ontology references, or full ontology URI's.
        
        See Search Services for additional implementation details.
