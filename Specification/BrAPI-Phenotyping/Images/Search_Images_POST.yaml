      description: "Get filtered set of image meta data\n\nImplementation Notes\n\n- 'imageURL' should be a complete URL decribing the location of the image. There is no BrAPI call for retireiving the image content, so it could be on a different path, or a different host.\n\n- 'descriptiveOntologyTerm' can be thought of as Tags for the image. These could be simple descriptive words, or ontology references, or full ontology URI's.  \n\nSee Search Services for additional implementation details."
