        Implementation Notes
        
        - This call should be paired with 'PUT /images/{imageDbId}' for full capability
        
        - A server may choose to modify the image meta data object based on the actually image which has been uploaded. 
        
        - Image data may be stored in a database or file system. Servers should generate and provide the "imageURL" for retrieving the image, wherever it happens to live.
