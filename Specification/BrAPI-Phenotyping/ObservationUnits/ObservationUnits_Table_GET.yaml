      summary: Get a list of Observations in a table format
      description: |-
        <p>This service is designed to retrieve a table for observation values as a matrix of Observation Units and Observation Variables.</p>
        <p>The table may be represented by JSON, CSV, or TSV. The "Accept" HTTP header is used for the client to request different return formats. 
        By default, if the "Accept" header is not included in the request, the server should return JSON as described below.</p>
        <p>The table is REQUIRED to have the following columns</p>
        <ul>
          <li>observationUnitDbId - Each row is related to one Observation Unit</li>
          <li>At least one column with an observationVariableDbId</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The table may have any or all of the following OPTIONAL columns. Included columns are decided by the server developer</p>
        <ul>
          <li>observationUnitName</li>
          <li>studyDbId</li>
          <li>studyName</li>
          <li>germplasmDbId</li>
          <li>germplasmName</li>
          <li>plotNumber</li>
          <li>plantNumber</li>
          <li>blockNumber</li>
          <li>entryNumber</li>
          <li>replicate</li>
          <li>positionCoordinateX</li>
          <li>positionCoordinateY</li>
          <li>year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The JSON representation provides a pair of extra arrays for defining the headers of the table. 
        The first array "headerRow" will always contain "observationUnitDbId" and any or all of the OPTIONAL column header names. 
        The second array "observationVariables" contains the names and DbIds for the Observation Variables represented in the table. 
        By appending the two arrays, you can construct the complete header row of the table. </p>
        <p>For CSV and TSV representations of the table, an extra header row is needed to describe both the Observation Variable DbId and the Observation Variable Name for each data column. 
        See the example responses below</p>
