          Observation levels indicate the granularity level at which the measurements are taken. 
          
          `levelName` defines the level 
          
          `levelOrder` defines where that level exists in the hierarchy of levels. `levelOrder`s lower numbers are at the top of the hierarchy (ie field > 0) and higher numbers are at the bottom of the hierarchy (ie plant > 6). 
          
          `levelCode` is an ID code for this level tag. Identify this observation unit by each level of the hierarchy where it exists
