            <p>The table may have any or all of the following OPTIONAL columns. Included columns are decided by the server developer</p>

            <p>The JSON representation provides a pair of extra arrays for defining the headers of the table. 
            The first array "headerRow" will always contain "observationUnitDbId" and any or all of the OPTIONAL column header names. 
            The second array "observationVariables" contains the names and DbIds for the Observation Variables represented in the table. 
            By appending the two arrays, you can construct the complete header row of the table. </p>
