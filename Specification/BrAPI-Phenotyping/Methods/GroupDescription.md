API to manage the details of observation variable Methods. An observation variable is composed by the unique combination of one Trait, one Method and one Scale. A Method describes the way an observation should be collected. For example, an Observation Variable might be defined with a Trait of "plant height", a Scale of "meters", and a Method of "tape measure". This Variable would be distinct from a Variable with the Method "estimation" or "drone image processing".
